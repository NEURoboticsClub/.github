## Northeastern Robotics Club Offical Github Organization
This is a public organization with the intent of creating a communal area to hold all code for software written for the NURobotics club. Currently, many projects are hosted on personal github repositories and those are forked here. Keep in mind that forked repositories may be out of sync with the original repo and may need to be updated (by an admin so please ask us!).

## Moving Forward (This is for you Project Leads!)
Any future repositories created for any club related projects should be created under the organization's name. In order to create repositiories under the organization, you must be a member and members must be invited. Leads should ensure that all members are invited to the organization and can do so themselves or by asking an admin.
