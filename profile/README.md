## Northeastern Robotics Club Offical Github Organization
This is a public organization with the intent of creating a communal area to hold all code for software written for the NURobotics club. Currently, many projects are hosted on personal github repositories and those are forked here. Keep in mind that forked repositories may be out of sync with the original repo and may need to be updated (by an admin so please ask us!).

## Looking to join?
